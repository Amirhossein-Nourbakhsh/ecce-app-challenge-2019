            <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
            <p><h4><u>Public Space and Sustainability</u></h4>
            A sustainable community is one that is consistently improving and evolving to meet the needs and goals 
            of the individuals who reside within it. More people are choosing to live in cities and it is projected 
            that 75 percent of the overall population will live in an urban environment by the mid-century. The sustainability 
            of future communities depends on access to public space that recognizes the specific needs and desires of a community.<br><br>

            <h4><u>What is Accessibility and Public Space?</u></h4>
            Enacting public accessibility involves the process of designing space functionality to ensure usability for individuals 
            with a wide range of abilities and needs. Ultimately, this will lead to public spaces being accessible to all. A public 
            space is an area that is intended to be used by the general public, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age or socio-economic level. 
            These public gathering places include but are not limited to:<br><br>

            ·  Green Spaces<br>
               ·   Gardens<br>
               ·  Playgrounds<br>
                ·  Recreational Centres<br>
                ·  Libraries<br>
                ·  Plazas & Squares<br>
                ·  Community Halls<br><br>

            <h4><u>Benefit of Public Spaces</u></h4>
            Urban public spaces provide many benefits to cities and the communities within them. Open public spaces encourage community building 
            and engagement, strengthen environmental connectivity and promote economic growth. Access to public space fosters a sense of belonging 
            which directly influences the sustainability of community prosperity. Furthermore, a well used public space is a great indicator of the 
            overall quality of an urban environment. <br><br>

            <h4><u>The App: AccessToronto</u></h4>
            In Ontario, the laws surrounding accessibility are varied. This means that it is not
            guaranteed that a public space will be accessible to everyone. The intended goal of
            AccessToronto is to support sustainability as it relates to community well-being and urban development by highlighting information 
            regarding public space accessibility. This information can be used by community members as well as the City of Toronto and those 
            interested in urban planning. This application will help combat the issue of inaccessibility of public spaces
            in the Greater Toronto Area by allowing community members to input and search locations 
            that may meet their specific accessibility needs. AccessToronto also allows users to input new information or edit existing 
            information about attributes of specific locations. When barriers to accessibility are addressed, communities are strengthened and elevated, 
            aiding in the sustaining momentum of urban advancements.<br><br>

            <div id='app'>
                <form action="/index.html">
                    <input id="toapp" type="submit" value="Check out the app!" />
                </form>
            </div>
            <h2> How It Works </h2>
            <p>
                <b>AccessToronto has two main interfaces:</b><br>
                1.       Interface for users to search for a public space based on their accessibility needs<br>
                2.       Interface for users to input accessibility features of a public space<br><br>

            <h4><u>Search</u></h4>
            Users are able to choose from a selection of types of public spaces, provided in the app, that they are interested in accessing. 
            Types of public spaces that are provided include:<br><br>
            <center> Green Space <br>
                Garden<br>
                Playground <br>
                Library <br>
                Recreation Centre<br>
                Plaza<br>
                Community Hall<br><br></center>
            Users are then able to further specify the functionality parameters that they require from a space by choosing from the provided options 
            in the app. Searchable accessibility features include:<br><br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <p><center>Reserved parking <br>
                        Service Animal Friendly <br>
                        Elevators<br>
                        Automatic Doors<br>
                        Ramps<br>
                        Washrooms<br>
                        Braille Signs <br>
                        Auditory Signal<br></center></p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">

                        Seating <br>
                        Pathway<br>
                        Shelter <br>
                        Lighting Intensity <br>
                        Noise Level<br>
                        Slope Level<br><br></center></p>
                </div>
            </div>



            When users click the search button, public spaces that satisfy the input parameters are shown on the map.
            A pop-up for each space is provided and includes information regarding the address and accessibility features.

            <h4><u>Input</u></h4>

            Users can input and update locations to enhance upon AccessToronto’s database of public spaces within the Greater Toronto Area. 
            To add and share a new public space, a user can click the “Create New Space” button located at the bottom of the input panel, 
            then identify the location on the map.  After a location is selected, the “Create new accessible location” window will prompt 
            the user to report the following:<br><br>
            ·  Name<br>
                ·  Address<br>
                ·  Type of Space<br>
                ·  Accessibility Features <br><br>
            The user can then click the “Submit” button at the end of the form to finish the process. <br>

            <h4><u>Update a Space</u></h4>

            The user will also have the option to update the existing information for a public space on the map. To do this, the user can click
            on the point of interest on the map to display the associated pop-up window. Clicking on the ‘more options icon’ located in the bottom 
            right corner provides a drop-down menu ***check and see what it actually is, with an “Edit” option. Choosing this will bring the user to 
            the “Edit Location” form, which is similar to the “Add New Accessible Space” form. The user can make the necessary updates and then click
            “Submit”. Upon completion of the process, a confirmation message indicating that the location has been updated is displayed.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations and Potential Modifications</h2>
        <p>
            Due to limitations in data availability regarding current accessibility features, members of GISt the 4 of Us created data to be included 
            in the app to allow for demonstration of app capabilities and usage. This data includes accessibility information about green spaces, gardens, 
            playgrounds, and plazas. <br><br>

            We love this app and imagine a bright future for it. Here are some key modifications we would like to include:<br><br>
            ·         The option to provide directions to a chosen point of interest based on a starting location provided by the user.<br>
            ·         Providing routes that include travel via public transportation and<br>
            ·         In-app text customization including larger font size and inverted<br>
            ·         More language options<br>
            ·         The option to add pictures of the space and its features which would be included in the pop-up <br><br>
            
        </p>
