My name is Andrea Zagar, and I’m a student in the Advanced GIS Diploma program at the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS) in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia. I graduated from Western University in 2017 with an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering. 
To me, GIS is an exciting combination of geography, programming, and data analysis that provides a unique perspective of the world around us. When I’m not working on maps, you can find me reading, cooking, stargazing or exploring the outdoors.
