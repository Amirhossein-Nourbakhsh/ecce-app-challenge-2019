Robert Anderson: (left) I am from Hamilton, Ontario where I attended McMaster University, obtaining my BSc in Environmental Sciences with a Minor in GIS. After having the incredible opportunity to travel across Canada on the train, I returned to school to attend the Centre of Geographic Sciences for the Advanced Diploma in Geographic Sciences. I want to apply my GIS knowledge to improve the lives of people, particularly in the fields of transit and urban planning.

Anna Sobotka: (middle-left) I’m from Kelowna, and I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BSc in Earth and Environmental Sciences. I worked in the forestry industry, then travelled throughout Europe before coming to the opposite side of Canada to see what the other side has to offer. I came to COGS because I’ve always been interested in maps, and I want to learn more about GIS applications in environmental monitoring.

Ellen Uppington: (middle-right) I’m from Newmarket, Ontario, and I attended the University of Toronto, where I completed a BSc in Computer Science. During my Bachelor’s, I also studied GIS applications and forest conservation, and worked with Environment Canada on improving the processing of their weather radar. I came to COGS to learn more about spatial data and analysis and to explore different avenues of technology in the field of GIS, and because I like maps!

Nicole Peters: (right) I’m from Prince Edward Island and did my BSc in Earth Sciences at Dalhousie University, which is where I got my first taste of GIS. From there I moved to Germany, where I lived for 7 years, also completing my MSc in Marine Geosciences at the University of Bremen. I returned to Canada and have now come to COGS to deepen my understanding of GIS and learn about new applications, particularly in the marine and coastal realms. I am excited to see where GIS, and 3D GIS, can take us!
