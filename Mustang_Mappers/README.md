# App Goals

Sustainable communities are designed to be economically, socially, and environmentally connected while allowing for improvement and adaptation. Our app "Earthling" aims to connect people with sustainable initiatives, contribute new ideas, and organize opportunities. The application allows users to identify and report areas around London that promote sustainability.

Key focus areas:

Transportation 

  - Biking or hiking
  
Food 

  - Owned by locals, using local ingredients
  
  - Reduction of plastics
  
Shopping 

  - Zero-waste shop, (eg. Bulk Barn bring-your-own jar)
  
Groups

  - Community gardens, community centres
  
  - Eg. Envirowestern, ReHarvest, Urban Roots London, Zero Waste Forest City


# How to use the app

Earthling is an accessible interface that allows users to actively participate and contribute to the sustainability of their communities. This can be done by finding sustainable places that a person comes across or adding to the map places a user finds sustainable. Through real-time data collection, and the contribution of many people, we hope to make sustainable communities for everyone to enjoy.

Want to live more sustainably? Connect with the community? "Earthling" is the app that easily allows you to do that.
