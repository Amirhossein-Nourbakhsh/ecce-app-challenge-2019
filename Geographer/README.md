# Team Geographer App Challenge 2019

1. Goals

We made this app in an effort to educate the residents of the City of Toronto on how they can participate in and benefit from sustainable development practices. Discover how much money you can save on water bills annually and the amount of water you can conserve by implementing the sustainable practice of rainwater harvesting at your home, while also helping to reduce the negative effects of stormwater runoff in the urban landscape.

Rainwater harvesting is the practice of collecting rainwater from a roof or hard surface through gutters or conduits and diverting it to a storage container for future reuse. While it can be used for potable water, it is typically used for activities requiring non-potable water, such as flushing toilets, urinals, washing laundry, gardening, and irrigation.
While water is an abundant natural resource, there is a finite amount of freshwater available. This resource is threatened by urban, agricultural, and industrial pollution, as well as impacts on the hydrologic cycle due to climate change. Therefore, rainwater harvesting will not only assist urban residents in saving money on their annual water bill, but most importantly, will help to ensure the long-term availability of water for future generations. 

2. Characteristics

Our App takes advantage of the Dashboard theme to help display the benefits and information of using Rainwater Harvesting as an alternative to water usage in Toronto Ontario. The Dashboard theme most importantly allow you to see the amount of money in a certain extent on the map can save if all the houses added a rainwater harvest system to their house hold, often saving hundred of thousands of dollars within a few kiolmeter radius. With the integration of Wep appbuilder in the Dashboard theme, we are able to modify the map and select your address or neighbourhood to help individual users figure out the benefits and cost of adding a rainwater harvesting system.

3. In App Instructions in script format

Each polygon on the map represents a building footprint of a detached, semi detached, or townhouse residence. The user can select either a single address or multiple addresses which will be analyzed to determine rainwater harvesting potential and the coinciding benefits. Select a residence to open up a pop-up window with beneficial information on rainwater harvesting for the selected address, that includes estimated installment cost and recommended tank size. The dashboard panels located on the left side will output the percentage of annual water consumption that could be sourced from a rainwater harvesting system as well as the amount of money you could save if a household water usage was supplemented with a rainwater harvesting system. These will automatically update and display the collective values from all properties visible within the map extent. 

Each of the panels on the dashboard as well as the map can be enlarged by clicking on the ‘maximize’ button in the top right corner of the panel of your interest. You can then return to the main screen of the app by clicking on the ‘minimize’ button, located in the same area. 

There are a variety of ways to navigate the map. You can use the search bar in the top right corner to locate a specific address, use the zoom in and out feature to minimize or maximize the map, or choose your current location.

By searching your address the extent will change to your location. If you are unable to find your address via the search bar then you can uncheck the polygon layer using the layer list this will hide the building footprint layer. IF you are still unable to find your household, you can change the basemap to something like imagery to help you identify your desired location .

To generate your expected savings, simply open the ‘select’ widget, choose a selection type from the drop-down menu, and choose your place or places of interest on the map. Ensure the selection button is highlighted before proceeding. Point selection is recommended for single address analysis while polygon selection is recommended for analysis of multiple addresses as a whole.

The values on the dashboard will differ based on what has been selected. The side panels will update and become colour coded according to the percentage of your water and monetary savings. 

Red values indicate households will be saving less than 50% of their average annual water consumption and have less than 50% savings on water bills annually with use of rainwater harvesting.  Considering this, using a rainwater harvesting system might not generate the maximum possible benefit, but it can still be implemented on a smaller scale to replace water used for activities such as gardening or to fill up your backyard pool.

Yellow values indicate households will be saving between 50 to 100% of their average annual water consumption and have between 50 to 100% savings on water bills annually. This will be able to help benefit your household and be able to replace activities such as washing clothes or dishes.

The blue and green values indicate households will be saving more than 100% of their average annual water consumption and have more than 100% savings on water bills by practicing rainwater harvesting in their homes. This indicates that you are able to use rainwater for most if not all water based activities in the household.

Keep in mind that if you are selecting multiple locations that the dashboard is only considering the average consumption and cost for only one of the households.

TEAM MEMBERS (From Left to Right): 

MinJee Kim: I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at McMaster University in the Honours Geography and Environmental Science program. I am interested in using GIS applications for urban planning. During my free time I enjoy riding horses and meeting friends.

JunLi Hu: I am a fifth year Honours Earth & Environmental Science Co-op student with specialization at GIS. My career interests focus in GIS, Urban Planning, Environmental Assessment and Hydrogeology field. I have successfully completed the course including Introductory GIS, Advances in Geospatial Techniques, Advanced Raster GIS, Remote Sensing and Statistical Analysis. My previous Co-op work experience allows me to gain extensive experience in spatial data mapping/analysis, census data analysis, and electrical vehicle researches.

Todd Wong: I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying both Geography and Anthropology at McMaster University. My interest in GIS sparked in my third year of university after taking the introductory course. Over the past two years I have taken numerous GIS courses at McMaster University along with submitting projects to the ESRI Young Scholar Contest. This year I thought I would test my abilities by participating in the App Challenge.

Maryose D’Arienzo: As a fourth-year undergraduate studying biology and environmental sciences, I am interested in improving the environmental challenges we face, resulting from the coexistence of rich biodiversity, industry, and human population. Learning to use GIS has strengthened my spatial thinking abilities when solving problems and it has been an invaluable tool for analysis and communication in my studies. I am excited to participate in this year’s app challenge as a culmination of my GIS courses at McMaster. Additional hobbies include photography and playing guitar.
