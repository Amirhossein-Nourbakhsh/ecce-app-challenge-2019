Todd Wong: I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying both Geography and Anthropology at McMaster University. My interest in GIS sparked in my third year of university after taking the introductory course. Over the past two years I have taken numerous GIS courses at McMaster University along with submitting projects to the ESRI Young Scholar Contest. This year I thought I would test my abilities by participating in the App Challenge.

Maryose D’Arienzo: As a fourth-year undergraduate studying biology and environmental sciences, I am interested in improving the environmental challenges we face, resulting from the coexistence of rich biodiversity, industry, and human population. Learning to use GIS has strengthened my spatial thinking abilities when solving problems and it has been an invaluable tool for analysis and communication in my studies. I am excited to participate in this year’s app challenge as a culmination of my GIS courses at McMaster. Additional hobbies include photography and playing guitar.
