-Our project name
Non-Market Housing Advisor

- Mission Statement
To help the group of people who have an interest in non-market housing projects, we take safety, green transit and social interaction into considerations in order to find the most suitable housing projects within Vancouver area. The reason we are doing the project is to draw the public attentions on the group of people who are low-income yet still have rights to have wellbeing.

-Characteristics of the app
This story map plays a role as a housing advisor. With very intuitive step by step instructions, viewers can go through the app, taking considerations of three different aspects one by one. Most tabs contain WebAppbuilders, which provide functionalities that a single story map can't give. The last tab is a summary result of the analysis while considering all three aspects. Additionally, it gives the end users an option to add their feedback on the housing projects. Generally speaking, we are taking advantages of a story map for being intuitive and clear-storytelling, and the advantages of WebAppbuilders for being user-friendly and multifunctional, then combine them together in order to make our app more suitable for the pubic to use.

-Our Goals
The Non-Market Housing Advisor is developed to help people find their ideal home from 557 government non-market housing projects within Vancouver area. 
Through the experience with our app, people would find the most suitable locations with the consideration of safety, low carbon emission transportation and social interaction.
Our app is also designed to collect volunteered information from the public, which could be comments and feedback about these non-market housing projects.

-Our target audience
People looking for a non-market housing location with consideration of safety, green transit and social activities. Anyone from the public who is interested in this topic can be our potential audience.

-Limitations
1. Only three aspects are considered here for determining a qualified housing project. Other factors that is not included here can also be influential.
2. Spatial statistics about break and enter crime are in 2019. The conclusion based on that could be inaccurate because of only considering crimes happened less than 4 months. We are assuming the pattern of the crime doesn't change much from what we have here.
3. Although it works fine from laptops and smartphones, this app is designed for desktop computers.
