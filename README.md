## About ECCE App Challenge:

The ECCE App Challenge is an annual competetition that engages teams of students at each of the [Esri Canada GIS Centers of Excellence](https://ecce.esri.ca/wpecce/schools/) in the creation of innovative GIS applications within a one-week period, using Esri technology and Open Data to address a specific theme.  Full details of the App Challenge can be found on the [ECCE website](https://ecce.esri.ca/wpecce/app-challenge/).  The ECCE App Challenge in 2019 is the fifth iteration of the competition, which has been held annually since 2015.  All submissions from student teams participating in the challenge in previous years remain available in the [2015](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2015), [2016](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2016), [2017](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2017) and, [2018](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2018) repositories on GitHub.  Starting with the 2017 challenge, you may view team profiles, videos, and apps online through the [ECCE GitHub web page](https://esricanada-ce.github.io).

For 2019, teams participating the challenge were tasked to create an app that addresses issues related to either ***Sustainable Urban Development*** or ***Sustainable Communities***.  A total of 24 teams participated to create new apps that addressed a variety of themes, with all submissions completed by April 4th.  The code and documentation from each team is included in the subfolders of this repository, organized by team name.  To introduce you better to this year's particpating students, you can 'meet the teams' on the ECCE GitHub webpage for the 2019 App Challenge: [https://esricanada-ce.github.io/appchallenge/2019/](https://esricanada-ce.github.io/appchallenge/2019/).
